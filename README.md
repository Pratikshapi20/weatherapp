# weatherapp
📘 PROJECT SYNOPSIS 🌦 Project Title: WeatherApp 1️⃣ Introduction WeatherApp is a console-based application developed using Core Java. The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and implements CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This application allows users to manage weather information such as city name, weather description, and temperature through a simple menu-driven console interface. The main purpose of this project is to understand Java programming concepts, object-oriented principles, and the MVC design pattern.
•	Objective of the Project The main objectives of this project are: To implement CRUD operations using Core Java To understand MVC architecture To apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts To create a structured and modular Java application To develop a console-based interactive system -Attributes: id city description temperature Responsibilities: Store weather data Provide getters and setters Provide a toString() method for displaying data This module only handles data representation.
🔹 2. Service Module
Package: com.weatherapp.service
Class: WeatherService.java
Description:
The Service module contains the business logic of the application.
Responsibilities:
Add new weather records
View all weather records
Update existing weather records
Delete weather records
Store data using ArrayList
This module performs all CRUD operations.
🔹 . Controller Module
Package: com.weatherapp.controller
Class: WeatherController.java
Description:
The Controller module handles user interaction.
Responsibilities:
Display menu options
Accept user input
Call service methods
Control application flow
It acts as a bridge between the user and the service layer.
•	System Architecture
User (Console Interface) ↓ Controller ↓ Service ↓ Model
The MVC architecture ensures proper separation of concerns and better code organization.
•	Features of the Application Add Weather Record View All Weather Records Update Weather Record Delete Weather Record Exit Application
•	Conclusion WeatherApp is a simple yet effective Core Java project that demonstrates the implementation of CRUD operations using MVC architecture. This project helps in understanding: Object-Oriented Programming concepts Java Collections Modular coding structure
