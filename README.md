📘 Project Synopsis
 Project Title: WeatherApp
WeatherApp is a simple console-based application developed using Core Java. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The application allows users to add, view, update, and delete weather details like city name, description, and temperature using a menu-driven system.
The Model stores weather data, the Service handles business logic using ArrayList, and the Controller manages user input and application flow.
This project helps in understanding Core Java concepts, Object-Oriented Programming, MVC architecture, and collection framework. It is a basic project for learning structured and modular Java application development.
